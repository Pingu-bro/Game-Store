    Gamestore a digital distribution platform developed by GameDev Corporation, which offers digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer gaming, video streaming and social networking services.<br><br>
    We also provide the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality.<br><br>
    The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Gameworks, which developers can use to integrate many of GameDev's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through GameDev Workshop.<br><br>
    Though initially developed for use on Microsoft Windows operating systems, versions for Mac OS X and Linux were later released.<br><br>
    Mobile apps with connected functionality with the main software were later released for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices in the 2010s.<br><br>
    The GameDev platform is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, estimated in 2013 to have 75% of the market space.<br><br>
    By 2017, users purchasing titles through GameDev totaled roughly $4.3 billion, representing at least 18% of global PC game sales.<br><br>
    By early 2018, the service had over 150 million registered accounts with a peak of 18.5 million concurrent users online.<br><br>
    The success of the Steam platform has led to the development of a line of GameDev Machine microconsoles, as well as the GameDev operating system.<br><br>
